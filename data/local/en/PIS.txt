Individual Safety Plan (PIMS)

In the face of major risks, protect yourself and your loved ones!
Crisis preparedness is a shared responsibility. It falls not only on public authorities but also on every individual citizen, who must be able to keep themselves safe while awaiting assistance. Taking steps in advance to ensure your safety until danger has passed improves the overall crisis response.

When emergency services are less overwhelmed, they can respond more effectively to urgent situations‚Äîsaving more lives.

To prepare for major risks, it's strongly recommended to create your own Individual Safety Plan (PIMS).
üßæ What is the PIMS?

To be ready for major risks (floods, storms, industrial accidents, etc.), preparation is key. The PIMS is a simple, accessible method for everyone‚Äîby filling out a clear, concise document.
