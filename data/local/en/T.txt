Flood Events

    “We had nothing left... We lost everything, everything...”

After an hour, we realized that water was entering the house. We started moving things up to protect them. Two hours later, the water was rising much faster. We were swimming in the yard! A second wave came, and we realized we weren’t going to make it.

A flood means: no gas, no electricity, no heating, no phone, no radio... total blackout.

When we opened the door, there was mud everywhere, furniture overturned. We didn’t even know where to begin. Inside the house, the water reached between 1.6 and 1.8 meters in some areas.

You know, being flooded like that... you’re in a daze afterwards. All I wanted to do was try to save a few things. You don’t think, you’re in another state.

We lived with my son for two months. Then at my sister’s. Later, we rented an apartment. We were away from our home for 10 months... Ten months! We had to tear everything down and rebuild—walls, insulation—everything was ruined. Completely ruined... It was awful.

Water had built up behind the walls around my property. When there was too much, the walls gave way and it turned into a torrent.

Some people were scarred for life. Now, every time there’s a storm, they wonder what’s going to happen.

There were childhood memories I had stored in the basement—my wife said they were cluttering the upper floors. So I had carefully boxed them up, taped everything... Well, so much for that.

    “Water is terrible... You can’t stop it.”

Honestly, it's a bit silly, but I tried to save the wine. I was hauling bottles up in floating trash bins. It sounds crazy now, but I think I wasn’t in my right mind. It was the only way I felt like I could do something.

It was Christmas. All the kids’ presents ended up at the back of the garden, completely ruined.

For insurance, you mustn’t throw anything away—absolutely nothing! Don’t take anything to the dumpster. You should have a big yard and just leave it all out for two months if needed! Even photos aren’t enough for insurers.

Lots of people didn’t even have shoes left. No injuries, but the psychological distress was huge.

I was going down to the basement in my swimsuit!

I didn’t even recognize the village anymore.

    “It was chaos.”

People running everywhere, survivors arriving, overwhelmed local officials. Firefighters, confused volunteers. It felt like a buzzing hive around the town hall, with a sense of powerlessness facing all those needs.

People were stranded on rooftops waiting to be airlifted. Some spent two hours up in trees!

There was nothing but mud throughout the village. Mud everywhere, cars scattered, fallen tree trunks... Everything was brown.

We were lucky it happened at night. If it had been during the school day, it would’ve been a disaster.

Mud everywhere—and a diesel smell. Diesel everywhere.

You’d see people going around in rowboats.

Helicopters, police, rescuers with canoes... It was terrifying.

    “A disaster of massive proportions...”

We felt completely overwhelmed. At the peak of the operation, it seemed like our capacity to respond was completely maxed out. (Firefighter)

By 4 a.m., people were still missing.

In crisis management like that, there’s no time to follow the rules—waste sorting laws, food safety regulations, contract procedures... You can't tell people: “Wait a bit longer in the water while we put out a tender.” No. You get people to safety.

We had a drinking water crisis. For 5 days, we had to supply 20,000 people with bottled water.

We shut down the factory, not even knowing what would happen next.

I had animals. I tried to rescue some, but it became a torrent. I couldn’t stay upright. I saved a few, some ducks... You’d think ducks can swim, but the current was so strong they got smashed into trees. I didn’t even think about the diesel. They died 10 days later—I should’ve washed them.

When we returned to work at the pharmacy, it was already a small victory—something to keep our minds busy. We weren’t cleaning anymore, we were selling medicine again. Doing something useful.

Some businesses were directly flooded and couldn’t operate—they were standing in water. Others were indirectly affected: suppliers, customers of those businesses.

The retirement home flooded too. We didn’t want to shut it down, knowing that if we did, it might never reopen. There was no gas, no electricity. In the end, we evacuated about 30 residents.

A special recovery program was launched by the State, Region, and local authorities: €126 million in aid.

    “We lost everything. Everything.”

1.28 meters of water in the yard. Brand-new trucks swept away. Everything gone. No computers, no billing software. Business stopped for a week, then resumed at 50%. Two months later, we were back to full capacity. We got our insurance money 6 months later. Without savings, we would’ve shut down for sure.
But also: incredible solidarity.

People were amazing. My neighbor helped us until 3 a.m.!

After 3 or 4 months, people got tired. Flood stories were everywhere—radio, TV, newspapers. Always something about the victims. People started saying, “Again with the flood victims? What are they, celebrities now?”

But the solidarity was real. People who’d never helped a neighbor in their life showed up. Material donations came from companies and individuals alike.

Even temp workers showed up to help save the factory equipment—without being asked. All day, people came of their own accord to protect their workplace.
