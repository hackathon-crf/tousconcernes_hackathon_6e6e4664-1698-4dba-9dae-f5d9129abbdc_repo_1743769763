1. ACTION TO BE TAKEN

Before any crisis / Major risks

The population must be made aware of proper behavior beforehand in order to react appropriately from the moment the national alert signal is triggered until the end-of-alert signal is given. As such, "every person contributes to civil security through their behavior" in accordance with Article L721-1 of the French Code of Internal Security.

At a minimum, each citizen should prepare by:

    Getting informed about the risks and procedures that may impact them at home, at work, or during leisure activities (vacations, sports, etc.);

    Preparing an emergency kit. For more information and to complete your kit:

        http://www.gouvernement.fr/risques

In the event of any alert (SNA, FR-ALERT, official notifications, media, and social networks, etc.):
As soon as you become aware of a public alert:

    Take shelter (in the nearest building, etc.);

    Do not go to pick up your children at school, as they are protected by their teachers;

    Get information on the situation;

    Unless it's a life-threatening emergency, do not make phone calls, to keep the networks available for emergency services;

    Follow official instructions, which may include:

        If asked to shelter-in-place, at a minimum:

            Close doors and windows;

            Seal doors, windows, and ventilation openings;

            Turn off ventilation or air conditioning systems.

        If asked to evacuate, at a minimum:

            Take your pre-prepared emergency kit with you.

In the event of an epidemic

To limit the spread of contagious infectious diseases, government services may share general information regarding the implementation of specific measures, such as barrier actions and physical distancing.

To reduce the spread of respiratory or contact-transmitted diseases, minimum measures include:

    Regularly washing hands or using hand sanitizer;

    Coughing or sneezing into your elbow or tissue;

    Blowing your nose with a single-use tissue and discarding it;

    Avoiding touching your face;

    Maintaining at least one meter of distance from others;

    Greeting without handshakes or kisses.

Additionally, wear a mask when a one-meter distance cannot be maintained.
2. PREPARING FOR A DISASTER

Any rescue or survival effort will be more effective if it has been prepared and even planned in advance.

Preparing for a disaster means carrying out a number of preliminary actions aimed at helping everyone:

    Better understand the importance of risks,

    Know about emergency resources available,

    Know how to act in their absence to limit damage—or survive.

Preparation must take into account each person’s environmental, geographical, and family situation. Using a "family self-protection plan" helps with this preparation (Appendix 2).
a) Getting informed about risks

You can get information on major risks and advice on what to do from:

    Your town hall, which is required to provide citizens with a local information document on major risks (DICRIM), particularly those likely to affect the municipality;

    The prefecture;

    The fire department;

    The local or regional branch of the French Red Cross;

    Your doctor;

    Approved public websites such as www.ff72.org.

b) Knowing how to alert emergency services

Knowing the emergency numbers and how to contact public rescue services in case of an accident or disaster is essential. These numbers and procedures are detailed in the "PSC: Alert" chapter of this guide.

It is also important to know the population alert signals that warn of an imminent disaster (see above), as well as the first steps to take in response (see previous page: CAT).
c) Establishing family instructions

A few simple actions can help a family adopt the right behavior:

    Identify and label the places to shut off water, electricity, and gas. A label above the valve helps even a small child act.

    Store a spare set of house or apartment keys, and important documents in a safe, accessible place.

    Plan a family meeting point after the disaster in case of separation (a gathering point, contact person), as communication methods (e.g., mobile phones) may not work.

        Each family member should apply this plan.

        Children will only use this if they are not at school, as schools have their own regrouping plans.

Preparing also involves knowing the emergency plans of various facilities (workplaces, hotels, schools). These are often communicated through posters, evacuation maps, or signs (EMERGENCY EXIT). They are tested regularly. It is advisable to do the same at home.
d) Knowing first aid techniques

Knowing basic first aid helps not only to assist an injured or unwell person but also to care for yourself and recognize injuries or symptoms of illness.
This knowledge is provided through specific training: Citizen First Aid.
e) Understanding fundamental survival needs

These are detailed in the chapter on survival principles. Knowing them helps build a resource stockpile for emergency use.

This stockpile, often called a Catakit, is a real emergency kit for disaster situations. An inventory is provided in Appendix 3.
The French Red Cross provides examples of Catakits during training sessions (Fig. 3).
f) Reducing the economic impact of disasters

Preparing also means:

    Having cash on hand (since payment systems may fail),

    Having insurance coverage that includes major risks.
