Flooding

The Number One Natural Risk in France

Flooding is the leading natural risk in France in terms of the number of people exposed and the scale of damage it causes. It affects all regions of both mainland France and overseas territories. Increasingly frequent and intense due to climate change, floods threaten lives, homes, and jobs.
What is a Flood?

A flood is the temporary submersion of areas that are usually dry.

Flooding can be caused by:

    River overflow (flooding from rising water levels):
    This is the most common type. When water levels rise significantly, rivers can overflow their banks and flood surrounding land.

    Urban runoff:
    During very heavy rainfall in cities, water cannot infiltrate the ground because it is impermeable (concrete, asphalt). Drainage systems can quickly become overwhelmed. Rainwater then flows along streets, sometimes forming dangerous currents, until it reaches a river or another drainage system.

    Rising groundwater levels:
    This occurs when the water table (an underground reservoir) becomes saturated and rises to the surfaceâ€”often after prolonged rain or flooding. Rising groundwater can flood basements and damage buildings due to water infiltrating walls. Over time, this can weaken mortar in the structure. Pumping water from basements must be done carefully to avoid damaging walls from differences in water pressure.

    Coastal flooding (marine submersion):
    Along coastlines, unfavorable weather and ocean conditions (often involving strong waves and high onshore winds) can cause sea levels to rise and flood coastal areas.

Flash floods and slow floods: Both are dangerous

Some floods, known as "flash floods," are marked by extremely rapid water level rise. The level of a river can increase by several meters in less than two hours. The flow can be so strong that just 30 cm (1 foot) of water can sweep away a car. Notable examples include:

    Vaison-la-Romaine (1992)

    Aude (1999)

    Alpes-Maritimes (2020, after Storm Alex)

Slow-onset floods have a more prolonged impactâ€”both during the flood and the receding phase. They can disrupt daily life, cutting off infrastructure and services (roads, electricity, phones) for several days or even weeks.
An example is the 1910 Seine flood, which paralyzed Paris for over a month and caused significant economic losses.
How to Stay Informed and Protect Yourself from Flood Risk

Whatever the type of flood, if there is a warning, itâ€™s important to:

    Stay informed about the situation and how itâ€™s evolving.

At the national level, the French government monitors nearly 23,000 km of waterways 24/7, 365 days a year, through the Vigicrues network. This public service covers 75% of the population living in flood-prone areas and alerts both authorities and the public in case of high risk.

This information is also shared by MÃ©tÃ©o-France through its weather alert system.
